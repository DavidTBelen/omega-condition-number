# Supplementary material to the paper: "The ω-Condition Number: Applications to Preconditioning and Low Rank Generalized Jacobian Updating."
Authors: **Woosuk Leo Jung, David Torregrosa-Belén, Henry Wolkowicz**


# Organization of the folder:

The folders is organized as follows:

>  1. SuppMaterial.pdf:
>      - Contains further formulae for ω-optimal preconditioners of different structures for linear systems.
>      - The empirics about clustering of eigenvalues provided by the optimal ω- and κ-optimal diagonal preconditioners in Section 2.3 of the main paper are extended to a subset of test matrices from the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection.
